## 🚀 Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- Web Speech API (voice input/output)
  
## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Features
- 🎤 Voice-to-text input
- 💻 iMessage-like UI
- 🌐 Works on all devices

## ⚠ Limitations
- Although I tried using something that would work universally, it appears that this works best on Google Chrome specifically, not even Chromium-based browsers.
